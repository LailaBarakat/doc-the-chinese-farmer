<h2>The story</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="bold">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em>
</p>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <span class=bad">bad</span> ,</q> and the farmer responded, <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em>
</p>
<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span>  — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

    <tr class="grey">
        <th>Event</th>
        <th><span class="good">Good</span> or Bad?</th>
    </tr>
    <tr class="white">
        <td>Lose a horse</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="grey">
        <td>Win more horses</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="white">
        <td>Son injury</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>
    </tr>

        <td>Avoid war</td>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><span class="good">Good</span> and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
